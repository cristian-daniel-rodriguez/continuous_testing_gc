# Continuous Testing with GitHub Copilot

The code was created using GitHub Copilot to observe the capabilities of the tool and determine if it can be used for automated testing.

Acronyms: 
- GC = GitHub Copilot
- GCC = GitHub Copilot Chat

# Results Description

## Observations
üìÑ General:
- GC can be used for doing Continuous Testing, however the GCC needs to be used for additional help
    - Mainly, the GCC is very helpful for automating the generation of tests and/or KPIs for each new pull request, push, and/or release
    In this use case, GitHub Actions was used for the automation
- GCC is capable of generating a basic test report dashboard 
- GCC is helpful for explaining code
    - The explanation of the selected code is well described, of course you will need some programming knowledge to understand
- GCC is really useful and quicker compared to searching on the internet

‚úÖ Positive:
- Multiple CI framework options proposed for doing the automation tests
- If you make any modification in the automatically generated code, for the following automatic generations includes the change made manually by the user
- The solution can be extended for other uses like KPI evaluations
- GC propose some other related useful functions that can be added to the scripts
- The code documentation provided by GCC using docstrings is pretty good

‚ùå Negative
- Needs the GCC functionality
- Future questions to GCC had to be made in order to get the entire workflow running correctly
- The proposed functions from GC used libraries that have not been previously imported and it does not warn you
